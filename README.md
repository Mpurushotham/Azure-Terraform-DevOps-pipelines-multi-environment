# Azure-Terraform-DevOps-pipelines-multi-environment
The purpose of building a Multi-Environment Infrastructure project using Terraform, Azure DevOps, and Azure Cloud 💻☁️.

# This mini project Repo includes:

🔹 Separate environments provisioning from scratch - Dev, QA, and Prod
🔹 Reusable Azure RM provided Terraform modules for infrastructure creation without much customization
🔹 Azure DevOps pipeline (YAML) with 

```bash
        plan → tfsec scan → manual approval → apply
```
🔹 Centralized remote state management in Azure Storage


## 💡 Key learnings for me:

 ✔️ Structuring **IaC Code with Terraform** for real-world use
 ✔️ Automating workflows using **Azure DevOps pipelines**
 ✔️ Adding security and approvals in CI/CD pipelines -- a bit of real real-world example + DevSecOps process
 ✔️ Hands-on with multi-environment infra creation
